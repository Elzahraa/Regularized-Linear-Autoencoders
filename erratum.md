# Erratum

- Section 2.3 should read: "In fact, L_2-regularization reduces the
symmetry group from GL_k(R) to O_k(R), making the [right] singular
vectors of the encoder and [left] singular vectors of the decoder
well-defined."

- The final sentence of Appendix B should read: "And since R^m is
contractible, their method should in principle extend to finding
critical points of higher index that form a *contractible chain
complex*, flowing along gradient trajectories from one minimum
to all minima through index-1 saddles, from those index-1 saddles
to other index-1 saddles through index-2 saddles, and so on until
contractibility is satisfied. Note there may exist additional
"disconnected" critical points forming *null-homotopic chain
complexes*, such as a pair of adjacent-index critical points with
a single gradient trajectory between them."
